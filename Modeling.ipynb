    "KC Makes Music is the stage name for my cousin, who is a hip hop artist on spotify. I thought it would make for an interesting learning experience if I used my data science skills to try and help him gain listeners on the platform. He has had some success, but understanding what to do to gain monthly listeners and gain a following tends towards the arcane. Spotify has an extremely robust database, so I knew there was an opportunity here to help my cousin increase his listener base, and therefore expand his reach as an artist.\n",
    "\n",
    "After looking at the available angles for this project, I decided that one way to go about this was to survey recent hop hop tracks and try to build a model that could predict if a previously unreleased song had potential to be popular in the current scene. I would gather a random assortment of songs (of all popularity scores), take their preview audio files, transform them into spectrograms, and then feed them through a neural network. This would, hopefully, provide a model that has picked up on common features among the popular songs such that it could tell if a new song would be popular. My cousin has a number of unreleased, finished tracks which we could put through the model. If it's accurate enough, it could determine which of the tracks would do well. If none of them do well, it would signal to my cousin that his tracks could use more work, and we could re-test them in an iterative manner. Furthermore, I could use LIME to determine what in particular the model is finding important and pass that information along to my cousin, to focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, it is most important that the model can separate between the two classes. Having a model that mixes up popular and unpopular songs is useless. A false positive means that my cousin releases a song that won't do well, and a false negative means that my cousin overproduces a song that is good as it was. Either way, we ruin good work. With this in mind, accuracy is a useful metric, but ROC-AUC is the preferred metric to use, as it measures how well the two classes can be separated."

    "All data comes from Spotify. Using [Spotipy, a python interface for the Spotify web API,](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/#) I gathered information on random songs in the genre \"hip-hop\" released 2019-2021. Random tracks were generated adapting a method outlined [here](https://perryjanssen.medium.com/getting-random-tracks-using-the-spotify-api-61889b0c0c27). The data included an http link to a ~30 second mp3 preview audio file, and a popularity score. This score ranged 0-100, with 100 being the most popular. Popularity was trimodal, with a huge peak at 0, a small peak at ~28 and a large peak at ~45."
